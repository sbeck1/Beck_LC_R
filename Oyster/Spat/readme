Spat Collecter Data Processing

September 11, 2018:  Reformatted shell/tile spat data using final conventions where possible. Started summary scripts.

September 12, 2018:  Scripts expanded to standardize shell spat collector by weight/volume and make summary graphs for tile/spat collectors and comparisons.

September 20, 2018:  Created data entry spreadsheets

September 25, 2018:  Created error check scripts

Need to doublecheck calculations, input coordinates/check mapping options. 

June 12-13, 2019:  Updating tile figure format, begin write-up.

Feb 2020:  GAMs:  I processed the WQ data to create some monthly metrics meaningful to oyster reproduction/ecology:
				-number of measurements where salinty >5ppt (gametogenesis thought to be impaired below 5ppt)
				-number of measurements where temperature >25C (start of gametogenesis)
				-number of measurements where salinity >15ppt (high salinity boundary of oyster production zones in LA due to predation/disease)
